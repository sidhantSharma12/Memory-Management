Implemented two memory management algorithms: best fit and worst fit. 

Each algorithm has a memory intitialization function in which the user requests a chunk of free memory dynamically. The user can choose to either allocate memory using best fit or worst fit algorithm. 

There are also allocation and deallocation functions for both best fit and worst fit. This is done by maintaining a linked list for memory which has been allocated and not allocated.
